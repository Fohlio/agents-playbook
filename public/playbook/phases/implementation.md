# Phase â€¢ Implementation

## Goal
Execute technical implementation based on design specifications with high code quality and maintainability.

## Step Sequence
1. **setup-development-environment** [if new project or env changes]
2. **implement-data-models** [if data modeling required]
3. **implement-core-logic** - core business logic and algorithms
4. **implement-api-endpoints** [if API development]
5. **implement-user-interface** [if UI development]
6. **implement-integrations** [if external systems]
7. **implement-security-measures** [if security requirements]
8. **code-review-and-refactoring** - quality review and cleanup

## Context Required
- Design specifications and architecture
- Development environment access

## Skip When
- No implementation work (analysis/docs only)
- Implementation completed in previous session
- Only configuration/infrastructure changes

## Success Criteria
- All designed features implemented per specifications
- Code follows project standards and best practices
- Components integrated with proper error handling
- Security measures implemented as designed
- Code reviewed and issues addressed

## Key Outputs
- Working implementation of all features
- Clean, documented code following standards
- Database migrations (if applicable)
- API documentation (if applicable)
- Security implementation
- Code review completion
