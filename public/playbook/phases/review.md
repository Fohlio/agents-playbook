# Phase • Review & Assessment

## Goal
Critically assess workflow outputs, identify strengths and weaknesses, and determine readiness for next steps or completion.

## Step Sequence
1. **handoff-memory-board** [at phase start] - read context from previous agents
2. **code-review** [for code deliverables] - assess code quality, security, performance
3. **trd-review** [for technical docs] - evaluate technical specifications and feasibility  
4. **deliverable-review** [for any deliverable] - general quality and goal alignment assessment
5. **handoff-memory-board** [at phase end] - document review findings for next phase

## Context Required
- Completed deliverables from previous phases
- Original requirements and success criteria
- Implementation artifacts (code, docs, processes)
- Testing results (if applicable)

## Skip When
- Simple changes requiring no formal review
- Emergency fixes where speed is critical
- Deliverables already peer-reviewed and approved

## Success Criteria
- All deliverables critically assessed for quality and alignment
- Strengths and weaknesses clearly identified
- Issues categorized by priority and impact
- Clear recommendation on readiness to proceed
- Review findings documented for stakeholders
- Knowledge captured for future improvements

## Expected Duration
**Simple:** 30-60 min | **Standard:** 1-2 hours | **Complex:** 2-4 hours

## Key Outputs
- Review assessment reports
- Issue tracking with priorities
- Recommendation on proceeding vs. rework
- Quality improvement suggestions
- Lessons learned documentation
- Updated memory board with review context

## Review Types by Deliverable
- **Code Implementation** → code-review mini-prompt
- **Technical Documents** → trd-review mini-prompt  
- **Features/Products** → deliverable-review mini-prompt
- **Processes/Workflows** → deliverable-review mini-prompt
- **Mixed Deliverables** → combination of relevant review prompts
