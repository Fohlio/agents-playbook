# Phase • Review & Assessment

## Goal
Critically assess workflow outputs, identify strengths and weaknesses, and determine readiness for next steps or completion.

## Step Sequence
1. **handoff-memory-board** [at phase start] - read context from previous agents
2. **code-review** [for code deliverables] - includes self-reflection + assess code quality, security, performance
3. **trd-review** [for technical docs] - includes self-reflection + evaluate technical specifications and feasibility  
4. **deliverable-review** [for any deliverable] - includes self-reflection + general quality and goal alignment assessment
5. **update-review** [for updates/dependencies] - includes self-reflection + quick safety check
6. **handoff-memory-board** [at phase end] - document review findings for next phase

## Context Required
- Completed deliverables from previous phases
- Original requirements and success criteria
- Implementation artifacts (code, docs, processes)
- Testing results (if applicable)

## Skip When
- Simple changes requiring no formal review
- Emergency fixes where speed is critical
- Deliverables already peer-reviewed and approved

## Success Criteria
- All deliverables critically assessed for quality and alignment
- Self-reflection analysis completed with honest assessment of implementation choices
- Strengths and weaknesses clearly identified in both deliverables and approach
- Issues categorized by priority and impact
- Alternative solutions or improvements identified
- Clear recommendation on readiness to proceed
- Review findings documented for stakeholders
- Knowledge captured for future improvements

## Expected Duration
**Simple:** 30-60 min | **Standard:** 1-2 hours | **Complex:** 2-4 hours

## Key Outputs
- Self-reflection analysis with critical assessment of implementation decisions
- Review assessment reports
- Issue tracking with priorities
- Alternative approaches and improvements identified
- Recommendation on proceeding vs. rework
- Quality improvement suggestions
- Lessons learned documentation
- Updated memory board with review context

## Review Types by Deliverable
- **Code Implementation** → code-review mini-prompt (includes mandatory self-reflection)
- **Technical Documents** → trd-review mini-prompt (includes mandatory self-reflection)
- **Features/Products** → deliverable-review mini-prompt (includes mandatory self-reflection)
- **Updates/Dependencies** → update-review mini-prompt (includes mandatory self-reflection)
- **Mixed Deliverables** → combination of relevant review prompts

## Self-Reflection Integration
Each review mini-prompt now includes mandatory self-reflection as the first step:
- **Critical Self-Assessment**: Honest evaluation of own implementation decisions and approach
- **Alternative Analysis**: Consideration of what could have been done differently
- **Risk Identification**: Recognition of potential issues or weaknesses
- **Learning Recognition**: Acknowledgment of knowledge gaps and improvement opportunities
