## 🪞 Self-Reflection Analysis
**MANDATORY FIRST STEP:** Before reviewing deliverables, critically assess your own work:

### Implementation Self-Assessment
- **Decision Quality**: Were my approach and choices optimal for the requirements?
- **Completeness**: Did I address all requirements thoroughly?
- **Quality**: Could the deliverable be clearer, more comprehensive, or better structured?
- **Future Impact**: How will this deliverable affect future work and maintenance?

### Honest Self-Evaluation
