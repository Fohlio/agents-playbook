# Design Architecture

## Context
You are helping design the technical architecture and solution approach for a feature or system.

## Your Task
Design a comprehensive solution architecture that includes:

1. **High-Level Architecture**
   - System components and their interactions
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Integration points with existing systems

2. **Technical Specifications**
   - Technology stack recommendations
   - Database design (if applicable)
   - API interfaces (if applicable)

3. **Implementation Approach**
   - Development phases and milestones
   - Key technical decisions and trade-offs
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

4. **Documentation Output**
   - Create a `design.md` file with all architecture decisions
   - Include diagrams and technical specifications
   - Document rationale for key design choices

## Deliverable
- Comprehensive `design.md` file containing the complete technical design
- Clear architecture diagrams and specifications
- Implementation roadmap and technical decisions documented

## Notes
- Consider scalability, maintainability, and performance requirements
- Align with existing system architecture and coding standards
- Get design review from senior developers when possible
