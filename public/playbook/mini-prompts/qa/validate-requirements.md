# Validate Requirements

## Goal
Verify that the implemented solution meets all specified requirements and acceptance criteria through systematic validation.

## Context Required
- Original requirements and acceptance criteria
- Completed implementation

## Skip When
- Requirements were very simple and obviously met
- Implementation is partial or incomplete
- Stakeholders not available for validation
- Emergency deployment where formal validation is deferred

## Complexity Assessment
- **Task Complexity**: Medium - requires requirements analysis and validation skills

## Task Understanding Assessment
If task unclear - ask clarifying questions with multiple choice options

## Validation Categories

### Functional Requirement Validation
- **Feature Completeness** - all specified features implemented
- **Business Logic** - rules and workflows work as specified
- **User Interface** - UI meets design and usability requirements
- **Data Processing** - input/output handling meets specifications
- **Integration** - external connections work as required

### Non-Functional Requirement Validation
- **Performance** - response times and throughput meet targets
- **Security** - authentication, authorization, and data protection adequate
- **Usability** - user experience meets expectations
- **Reliability** - system stability and error handling appropriate
- **Scalability** - system can handle expected load and growth

### Acceptance Criteria Validation
- **Definition of Done** - all completion criteria satisfied
- **User Stories** - each story's acceptance criteria met
- **Business Value** - solution delivers expected business benefits
- **Quality Standards** - code quality and maintainability acceptable
- **Deployment Readiness** - solution ready for production use

### Compliance Validation
- **Regulatory Requirements** - industry or legal compliance met
- **Company Standards** - internal policies and standards followed
- **Architecture Guidelines** - design principles and patterns followed
- **Security Policies** - security requirements and best practices implemented
- **Documentation Standards** - required documentation complete

## Validation Techniques

### Requirement Traceability
- Map each requirement to implementation components
- Verify all requirements have been addressed
- Identify any missing or incomplete implementations
- Document any requirement changes or scope adjustments

### Acceptance Testing
- Execute user acceptance test scenarios
- Validate with actual business stakeholders
- Test real-world usage patterns
- Verify business value delivery

### Gap Analysis
- Compare requirements vs actual implementation
- Identify any functionality gaps
- Assess impact of missing features
- Recommend priority for addressing gaps

### Stakeholder Review
- Present implementation to business stakeholders
- Gather feedback on functionality and usability
- Validate against original business needs
- Obtain formal sign-off or approval

## Key Tasks
1. **Review original requirements** - re-examine initial requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Map implementation to requirements** - verify each requirement has been addressed
3. **Validate functional requirements** - confirm all specified functionality works correctly
4. **Validate non-functional requirements** - check performance, security, and usability requirements
5. **Test acceptance criteria** - verify all acceptance criteria are met
6. **Gather stakeholder feedback** - get validation from business stakeholders
7. **Document validation results** - create comprehensive validation report

## Common Validation Scenarios

### Feature Validation
- Test each feature against its specification
- Verify edge cases and error handling
- Validate user workflows and interactions
- Check data integrity and accuracy

### Performance Validation
- Measure actual performance against requirements
- Test under realistic load conditions
- Validate scalability characteristics
- Check resource usage and efficiency

### Security Validation
- Verify authentication and authorization work correctly
- Test data protection and privacy measures
- Validate input sanitization and security controls
- Check for common security vulnerabilities

### Usability Validation
- Test with actual users or stakeholders
- Validate user interface design and interaction
- Check accessibility and responsive design
- Gather feedback on user experience

## Validation Criteria

### Must-Have Requirements
- Critical business functionality implemented
- Core user workflows working correctly
- Essential integrations functional
- Security requirements met
- Data integrity maintained

### Should-Have Requirements
- Important but non-critical features
- Performance targets met
- Usability requirements satisfied
- Documentation complete
- Monitoring and alerting in place

### Could-Have Requirements
- Nice-to-have features
- Advanced functionality
- Optimization improvements
- Enhanced user experience
- Additional integrations

## Success Criteria
- All functional requirements verified as implemented
- Non-functional requirements met within acceptable ranges
- Acceptance criteria fully satisfied
- Stakeholder approval obtained
- Any gaps or issues clearly documented
- Clear approval or recommendations for next steps

## Key Outputs
- Requirements validation matrix
- Acceptance criteria verification report
- Gap analysis for any missing functionality
- Stakeholder sign-off documentation
- Recommendations for any improvements needed
- Final validation summary and approval status
