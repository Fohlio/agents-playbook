# Document Decisions

## Purpose
Document the approved fix strategy and business decisions to ensure clear communication, maintain decision history, and provide a reference for implementation and future decisions.

## Context
- **Fix Approach**: User-approved approach for fixing E2E test failures
- **User Approval**: Confirmation that the proposed strategy is acceptable
- **Business Requirements**: Business context and constraints for the fix
- **Technical Impact**: How the fix will affect the system

## Instructions
1. **Record Fix Strategy**: Document the approved approach to fixing the issue
2. **Capture Business Context**: Record why this decision was made
3. **Document Constraints**: Record any limitations or constraints that apply
4. **Record Assumptions**: Document assumptions made during decision-making
5. **Capture Timeline**: Record when the fix should be implemented
6. **Document Success Criteria**: Define how success will be measured

## Documentation Guidelines
- **Clear Language**: Use clear, concise language that's easy to understand
- **Complete Coverage**: Document all aspects of the decision
- **Stakeholder Focus**: Consider what different stakeholders need to know
- **Actionable Content**: Ensure documentation enables implementation
- **Historical Record**: Maintain decision history for future reference
- **Approval Tracking**: Clearly document who approved what and when

## Success Criteria
- Fix strategy is clearly documented
- Business context is well understood
- Constraints and limitations are recorded
- Implementation plan is actionable
- Rollback plan is defined
- Communication plan is established
