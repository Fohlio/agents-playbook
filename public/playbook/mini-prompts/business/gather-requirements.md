# Gather Requirements & Clarify Prompt (v3)

## 🎯 Goal
Extract crystal-clear business requirements, ask clarifying questions, and lock them down—no fluff.

## 📋 Context Assessment
Before gathering requirements, assess the existing documentation and project context:

### Existing Documentation
- **Current State:** Check for existing technical specs, user stories, or project notes
- **Documentation Quality:** Evaluate completeness and currency of available documents
- **Gap Analysis:** Identify missing information that needs to be gathered

### Document Generation Support
- **Requirements Format:** Determine appropriate format for requirements documentation
- **Technical Alignment:** Ensure requirements documentation meets technical needs
- **Integration Points:** Consider how requirements documentation fits into overall project documentation

## 📥 Context (ask if missing)
1. **Project Scope** – what's being built?
2. **System Users** – what are the different user types?
3. **Business Objectives** – why does this exist?
4. **Current State** – legacy systems / processes?
5. **Existing Docs** – technical specs, user stories, notes? (Y/N)

## 🔍 Clarifying Questions Phase
If requirements are unclear, use structured questions to fill gaps:

### Question Style
Always give multiple-choice or concrete examples for clear requirements.

> **Target users?**  
> A) End-users B) Admins C) Both D) Other: ____  
>
> **Priority?**  
> A) 🔥 Critical (today) B) High (this week) C) Medium (this month) D) Low

### Quick Templates
- **Bug Fix**  
  - Steps to reproduce?  
  - Expected vs. actual?  
  - Workarounds?  
- **New Feature**  
  - User types?  
  - Problem it solves?  
  - Flow happy-path?  
- **Refactor**  
  - Pain points?  
  - Perf hits?  
  - Desired end state?

### Clarification Checklist
- **Scope**  
  - [ ] Included vs. excluded functionality  
- **Constraints**  
  - [ ] Platform, perf, security  
- **Success**  
  - [ ] How will we know it's done?  
- **Dependencies**  
  - [ ] External systems, data, approvals

## 🚦 Skip if
- A validated requirements doc exists (<30 days) or scope is trivial/emergency.

## 🔍 Checklist
