# Setup CI/CD Pipeline

## Goal
Establish automated continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines to streamline development workflows, improve code quality, and enable reliable deployments.

**üìÅ Document Location**: Create CI/CD pipeline documentation in `docs/planning/` directory.

## Context Required
- Source code repository and project structure
- Target deployment environments
- Testing framework and test suites

## Skip When
- Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline already implemented
- Simple project that doesn't warrant automated pipeline
- CI/CD managed by dedicated DevOps team
- Only manual deployment processes required

## Complexity Assessment
- **Task Complexity**: High - requires DevOps expertise and automation skills

## Task Understanding Assessment
If task unclear - ask clarifying questions with multiple choice options

## CI/CD Platform Options

### Cloud-Based Platforms
- GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Azure DevOps, AWS CodePipeline, Google Cloud Build

### Self-Hosted Solutions
- Jenkins, TeamCity, Bamboo, GitLab CE

### Specialized Platforms
- CircleCI, Travis CI, Buildkite, Drone

## Pipeline Stages

### Source Control Integration
- **Webhook configuration** - trigger builds on code changes
- **Branch policies** - configure branch protection and review requirements
- **Merge strategies** - define how code changes are integrated
- **Tag management** - automate version tagging and release creation

### Build Stage
- **Environment setup** - configure build environment and dependencies
- **Compilation** - compile source code and generate artifacts
- **Dependency management** - install and cache project dependencies
- **Artifact creation** - package applications for deployment

### Testing Stages
- **Unit tests** - run fast, isolated tests for individual components
- **Integration tests** - test component interactions and integrations
- **End-to-end tests** - test complete user workflows and scenarios
- **Performance tests** - validate application performance under load

### Code Quality Stage
- **Linting** - check code style and formatting standards
- **Static analysis** - analyze code for potential bugs and issues
- **Security scanning** - scan for known vulnerabilities and security issues
- **Code coverage** - measure test coverage and enforce minimum thresholds

### Deployment Stages
- **Environment preparation** - prepare target deployment environments
- **Database migrations** - apply database schema changes
- **Application deployment** - deploy applications to target environments
- **Health checks** - validate deployment success and application health

## Testing Integration

### Test Automation
- **Unit test execution** - run comprehensive unit test suites
- **Test parallelization** - execute tests in parallel for faster feedback
- **Test reporting** - generate detailed test reports and coverage metrics
- **Flaky test detection** - identify and handle unreliable tests

### Quality Gates
- **Test coverage thresholds** - minimum code coverage requirements
- **Test failure handling** - stop pipeline on test failures
- **Performance benchmarks** - performance regression detection
- **Security vulnerability limits** - block deployment on security issues

## Deployment Automation

### Deployment Strategies
- **Blue-green deployment** - deploy to parallel environment and switch
- **Rolling deployment** - gradually replace instances with new version
- **Canary deployment** - deploy to subset before full rollout
- **Feature flags** - control feature rollout through configuration

### Environment Management
- **Development environment** - automated deployment from feature branches
- **Staging environment** - pre-production testing and validation
- **Production environment** - controlled deployment with approvals
- **Environment promotion** - promote releases through environments

### Configuration Management
- **Environment-specific configs** - manage configurations per environment
- **Secret management** - secure handling of credentials and secrets
- **Feature toggles** - runtime configuration of features
- **Infrastructure as code** - automated infrastructure provisioning

## Security Integration

### Security Scanning
- **Dependency scanning** - check for vulnerable dependencies
- **Container scanning** - scan container images for vulnerabilities
- **Static security analysis** - analyze code for security issues
- **Secrets detection** - prevent hardcoded secrets in code

### Access Control
- **Pipeline permissions** - control who can modify and run pipelines
- **Environment access** - restrict deployment permissions by environment
- **Approval workflows** - require approvals for production deployments
- **Audit logging** - track all pipeline activities and changes

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Pipeline Monitoring
- **Build metrics** - track build success rates and duration
- **Deployment metrics** - monitor deployment frequency and success
- **Lead time tracking** - measure time from commit to deployment
- **Failure analysis** - analyze patterns in pipeline failures

### Notifications
- **Build status** - notify team of build successes and failures
- **Deployment notifications** - alert stakeholders of deployments
- **Security alerts** - immediate notification of security issues
- **Performance alerts** - alert on performance degradation

## Success Criteria
- Code changes trigger automated build and test processes
- All tests pass before code can be merged or deployed
- Code quality gates prevent poor quality code from proceeding
- Deployments are automated and consistent across environments
- Failed builds and deployments trigger appropriate notifications
- Pipeline provides fast feedback to development team
- Deployment process is reliable and can be rolled back

## Key Outputs
- Automated CI/CD pipeline configured and operational
- Automated testing integrated into development workflow
- Code quality checks and security scanning enabled
- Automated deployment to multiple environments
- Pipeline monitoring and alerting configured
- Documentation for pipeline usage and troubleshooting
