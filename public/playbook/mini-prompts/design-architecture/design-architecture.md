## üéØ Objective
Design a **scalable, maintainable architecture** for a new feature within an existing codebase.  
Use established code patterns, libraries, and conventions already present in the project.

---

### Step 1 ‚Äî Context Discovery
1. **Search the codebase** for:
   - Similar or related features
   - Common architectural patterns (modules, naming, data flow)
   - Existing data models, APIs, or utilities that can be reused
2. Identify where this feature logically belongs (domain, service, or module).

### Step 2 ‚Äî Clarification
If context is missing or ambiguous, **ask concise, goal-oriented questions** to refine:
- Feature intent and scope
- Key data inputs/outputs
- Expected user or system interactions
- Non-functional constraints (scale, latency, data volume)

Keep it short and multiple-choice when possible.

### Step 3 ‚Äî Architecture Plan
Once context is clear, **generate the feature design**:

#### A) High-Level Plan
Describe the high-level plan for the feature and the overview of the solution.

#### B) Implementation Steps
List the implementation steps. For each, provide concise code snippets that cover:
- Essential interfaces, types, or classes to define
- Function or method signatures for all main operations
- Example scaffolding code that illustrates how components interact
- Describe main components and their responsibilities
- Show how they integrate with existing ones
- Include only relevant layers (API, service, DB, queue, etc.)`

Ensure each step is clear, actionable, and formatted for direct use in the codebase.

#### C) Output Format
Return:
- `design.md` ‚Äî the architecture plan in concise prose

### ‚öôÔ∏è Constraints
- Must align with existing code patterns
- Prefer reuse over creation
- Architecture should be scalable, composable, and easy to extend
- Keep output brief, technical, and actionable

### ‚úÖ Deliverable Format
- `.agents-playbook/[task-name]/design.md`
  - High-level description of components
  - Implementation steps with code snippets
