# Code Analysis

## Goal
Deep dive into codebase structure, patterns, and quality to understand implementation details and identify improvement opportunities.

**üìÅ Document Location**: Create code analysis reports in `docs/planning/` directory.

## Context Required
- Access to relevant codebase
- Scope of code to analyze (specific modules, functions, or areas)

## Context Gathering
If you don't have the required context, gather it by:
- **Codebase access**: Use file system tools to explore the project structure
- **Analysis scope**: Ask user which specific areas, modules, or components to focus on
- **Current issues**: Identify known problems, performance issues, or areas of concern
- **Analysis goals**: Understand whether focusing on architecture, performance, security, or maintainability

## Skip When
- Code is very simple and doesn't warrant deep analysis
- Analysis was completed in previous session
- Only configuration or documentation changes needed
- Emergency fix where analysis is not required

## Complexity Assessment
- **Task Complexity**: High - requires deep code analysis and architecture understanding

## Analysis Focus Areas

### Structural Analysis
- **Code Organization** - file/module structure and separation of concerns
- **Architecture Patterns** - MVC, Clean Architecture, microservices, etc.
- **Dependencies** - coupling between modules and external dependencies
- **Interface Design** - how components interact and communicate

### Quality Assessment
- **Readability** - naming conventions, comments, code style consistency
- **Maintainability** - ease of changes, modularity, and extensibility
- **Complexity** - method length, nesting levels, cyclomatic complexity
- **Code Smells** - duplicated code, long methods, god objects

### Performance & Security
- **Algorithm Efficiency** - Big O complexity of critical paths
- **Resource Usage** - memory leaks, inefficient database queries
- **Security Patterns** - input validation, authentication, authorization
- **Error Handling** - exception management and resilience patterns

## Analysis Process
1. **Explore Structure** - understand overall architecture and organization
2. **Identify Patterns** - document recurring design patterns and anti-patterns
3. **Assess Quality** - evaluate readability, maintainability, and complexity
4. **Find Issues** - locate potential problems, bottlenecks, and vulnerabilities
5. **Prioritize Findings** - rank issues by impact and effort to fix

## Key Deliverables
- **Architecture Overview** - high-level system structure and components
- **Quality Assessment** - code quality metrics and improvement areas
- **Issue Inventory** - prioritized list of problems with specific locations
- **Recommendations** - actionable suggestions for improvements
- **Technical Debt** - quantified debt and remediation plan

## Tools and Techniques
- Static analysis tools (SonarQube, ESLint, etc.)
- Performance profilers and monitoring tools
- Security scanners and vulnerability assessments
- Code coverage and testing tools
- Documentation and complexity analyzers

## Success Criteria
- Clear understanding of codebase structure and architecture
- Comprehensive inventory of code quality issues
- Prioritized recommendations with effort estimates
- Specific examples and locations for each finding
- Actionable improvement plan aligned with project goals
