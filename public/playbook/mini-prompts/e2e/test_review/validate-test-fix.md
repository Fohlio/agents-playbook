# Validate Test Fix

## Purpose
Validate that implemented test fixes are working correctly by running tests locally and ensuring they pass consistently, while maintaining the original test intent and functionality.

## Context
- **Implemented Fix**: Test fixes that have been implemented
- **Test Environment**: Local Playwright setup for validation
- **Original Failures**: What was failing before the fix
- **Test Intent**: What the tests were originally supposed to verify

## Instructions
1. **Run Fixed Tests**: Execute the previously failing tests to verify they now pass
2. **Validate Test Intent**: Ensure tests still verify the intended functionality
3. **Check Consistency**: Run tests multiple times to ensure they're not flaky
4. **Verify Fix Quality**: Assess the quality and reliability of the implemented fixes
5. **Document Results**: Record validation results and any remaining issues
6. **Assess Readiness**: Determine if fixes are ready for integration testing

## Validation Guidelines
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Run all fixed tests multiple times
- **Intent Preservation**: Verify tests still verify intended functionality
- **Consistency Check**: Ensure tests are not flaky or intermittent
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate the overall quality of implemented fixes
- **Documentation**: Record all validation results and findings
- **Readiness Assessment**: Determine if fixes are ready for next steps

## Success Criteria
- All previously failing tests now pass
- Tests maintain their original intent and functionality
- Tests are consistent and not flaky
- Fix quality meets established standards
- No new issues are introduced
- Fixes are ready for integration testing
