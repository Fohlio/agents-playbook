# Integration Testing

## Purpose
Execute E2E tests as part of the broader test suite to ensure they integrate properly with existing tests, don't cause conflicts, and work correctly in the overall testing environment.

## Context
- **Validated Test**: Test that has passed local execution and stability validation
- **Test Suite**: Complete test suite including existing E2E tests
- **Test Environment**: Integrated testing environment with all dependencies
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests that can run simultaneously without conflicts

## Instructions
1. **Run Full Test Suite**: Execute the complete test suite including new tests
2. **Monitor Integration**: Watch for conflicts or interference with existing tests
3. **Check Parallel Execution**: Verify tests can run simultaneously without issues
4. **Validate Cross-Browser**: Test across different browsers if applicable
5. **Assess Performance Impact**: Evaluate how new tests affect overall suite performance
6. **Document Integration Results**: Record any issues or conflicts found

## Integration Guidelines
- **Full Suite Execution**: Run complete test suite to identify conflicts
- **Conflict Detection**: Look for tests that interfere with each other
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track overall suite performance impact
- **Cross-Browser Validation**: Ensure tests work across different browsers
- **Parallel Execution**: Verify tests can run simultaneously
- **Documentation Update**: Update test documentation with integration findings

## Success Criteria
- New tests integrate successfully with existing suite
- No conflicts with existing tests are found
- Performance impact is minimal and acceptable
- Cross-browser compatibility is verified
- Parallel execution works correctly
- Integration issues are identified and resolved
