# Plan Test Structure

## Purpose
Design the overall structure and organization of E2E tests based on identified scenarios, feature complexity, and existing test patterns in the Playwright repository.

## Context
- **Test Scenarios**: Prioritized scenarios from determine-test-priority step
- **Feature Complexity**: Assessment of how complex the feature is to test
- **Existing Test Patterns**: Current test structure and organization in the repository
- **Page Object Models**: Existing page objects that can be reused or extended

## Instructions
1. **Analyze Test Organization**: Review how existing tests are structured in the repository
2. **Design Test Hierarchy**: Plan the logical grouping and organization of test files
3. **Identify Reusable Components**: Determine which page objects, fixtures, and utilities can be reused
4. **Plan Test Data Strategy**: Design approach for managing test data and state
5. **Consider Test Dependencies**: Map out dependencies between different test scenarios
6. **Design Test Flow**: Plan the sequence and flow of test execution

```json

}
```

## Success Criteria
- Test structure follows established repository patterns
- Test organization is logical and maintainable
- Component reuse is maximized where possible
- Test data strategy is well-defined
- Dependencies are clearly mapped
- Implementation approach is practical and achievable
