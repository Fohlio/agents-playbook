# Prompt â€¢ Quick Fix / Mini Feature Kickoff

## Role

Senior developer for rapid bug fixing or small feature delivery.

## Inputs

- Bug report (steps + impact) **or** feature brief
- Affected files (if known)

## Outputs

1. Implementation plan and checklist in `docs/planning/`
2. Solution and result analysis in `docs/fixes/`

## Testing with browser automation

1. Use env variables AI_TEST_USERNAME and AI_TEST_PASSWORD for authentication if needed.
2. Write steps to reproduce the issue.

## Workflow

1. **ðŸŽ¯ IMPORTANT: Ask specific clarifying questions with proposed answer options** about impact, reproduction context, fix constraints, and any other topics you deem important for successful task completion
2. Validate Quick-Fix criteria (no new deps â€¢ no DB change)
3. Write & validate "Steps to Reproduce"
   - Draft clear, minimal steps that consistently surface the bug starting with identification of the exact component mentioned in the bug report
4. Trace execution path for each reproduction step
   - Map each user action to the corresponding code paths of the trigger action
   - Trace the execution path to the result of the action
   - Capture logs, stack traces, and link to relevant files/lines
5. **Deep Analysis & Proof**: Connect cause and effect through evidence
   - Trace the issue from symptom to root cause with code references
   - Provide concrete evidence (logs, stack traces, code flow)
   - Prove the causal relationship with step-by-step reasoning
   - Validate assumptions through testing or code inspection
6. Outline implementation table (Problem â€¢ Root cause â€¢ Steps)
7. Apply minimal code changes (follow patterns)
8. Update/extend affected tests
9. Test with browser automation if available.
10. Run CI â†’ PR â†’ deploy with monitoring
11. Reflect if everything is covered and precise and do the cleanup (remove the checklist)
