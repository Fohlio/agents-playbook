**Purpose**: Rapid resolution of bugs and implementation of small features  
**Use Case**: When you need to fix bugs or add small features without full documentation overhead  
**Complexity**: Simple to Medium - quick assessment and implementation
**Output**: Working solution with minimal documentation

### 5. [Development Kickoff](development-kickoff-prompt.md)
**Purpose**: Systematic development process from TRD to implementation  
**Use Case**: When you have a complete TRD and ready to begin development with automated testing and documentation  
**Complexity**: Variable - adapts based on implementation complexity assessment
**Output**: Working implementation with comprehensive tests and updated documentation

### 6. [N8N Workflow Creation](n8n-workflow-prompt.md)
**Purpose**: Create automated workflows using n8n platform  
**Use Case**: When you need to automate business processes, integrate systems, or create data pipelines  
**Complexity**: Medium - workflow design and configuration
**Output**: Ready-to-import n8n JSON workflow file

### Automation Levels
**High Automation**: Well-defined patterns, existing codebase extensions, simple fixes
- Use Quick Fix prompt for established patterns
- Leverage automated testing and validation
- Minimal human intervention required

**Medium Automation**: New features with known patterns, standard integrations
- Use TRD Creation ‚Üí Development Kickoff flow
- Combine automated analysis with manual review
- Moderate complexity requiring planning

**Low Automation**: Architectural changes, new technology, complex business logic
- Use Product Development for comprehensive planning
- Require extensive analysis and human guidance
- High complexity with multiple unknowns

### Complexity Assessment Matrix
| Indicators | Simple | Standard | Complex |
|------------|--------|----------|---------|
| New Dependencies | None | Few | Many |
| Architecture Changes | None | Minor | Major |
| Integration Points | None/Existing | Some | Multiple/New |
| Business Logic | Straightforward | Moderate | Complex |

## üéØ Enhanced Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Complexity | Urgency | Automation Level | Recommended Prompt | Why |
|----------|------------|---------|------------------|--------------------|-----|
| Production bug fix | Simple-Medium | Critical | High | [Quick Fix](quick-fix-prompt.md) | Rapid resolution with minimal risk |
| New product idea, unclear requirements | Complex | Low | Low | [Product Development](product-development-prompt.md) | Need comprehensive discovery and planning |
| Clear feature request, need technical spec | Standard | Normal | Medium | [TRD Creation](trd-creation-prompt.md) | Direct path to technical requirements |
| Have BRD, need technical implementation | Standard-Complex | Normal | Medium | [BRD to TRD Translation](brd-to-trd-translation-prompt.md) | Systematic translation with codebase analysis |
| Have TRD, ready to start development | Variable | Normal | High | [Development Kickoff](development-kickoff-prompt.md) | Automated implementation with quality assurance |
| Small enhancement or improvement | Simple | Normal | High | [Quick Fix](quick-fix-prompt.md) | Rapid implementation without overhead |
| Need to automate business processes | Medium | Normal | Medium | [N8N Workflow](n8n-workflow-prompt.md) | Create automated workflows and integrations |

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Critical Production Issues
For critical bugs or system outages:
1. **Immediate assessment**: Use Quick Fix prompt with minimal planning
2. **Focus on impact**: Prioritize fixing user-facing issues
3. **Leverage automation**: Use existing patterns and automated testing
4. **Document later**: Focus on resolution first, documentation second

### Hotfix Process
- Skip extensive planning phases
- Use existing code patterns
- Implement minimal viable fix
- Plan proper solution for later if needed

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Step 1: Assess Your Situation
1. **What do you have?** (Product idea, BRD, TRD, bug report)
2. **What's the complexity?** (Use complexity assessment matrix)
3. **What's the urgency?** (Critical, normal, planned)
4. **What automation is possible?** (High, medium, low)

### Step 2: Choose Your Path
Use the enhanced decision matrix to select the appropriate prompt based on your assessment.

### Step 3: Follow the Process
Each prompt includes:
