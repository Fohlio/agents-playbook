Feature 1

I want to add "skills" to playbooks
1. The skill is an MD file
2. Skill can reference different files and scripts inside the system as well, so storage should be implemented

The storage will be called Skill Studio
1. User can either create himself or use AI assistant
2. User opens the studio and creates the skills, adds files

Skills can be references inside workflows inside prompts.

Use stitch to create a design for skills studio

Feature 2
Tags system to workflows, skills and mini-prompts so we can easitly search and identify items.
Use tags skill for it

Feature 3
Add 3 dots menu to workflows and skill cards so user can perform basic actions with it and open the preview or redirect to workflow page.
Double click on the card should open the page where prompts related to the card are.
Clickin on the prompt will open preview modal.

Add 3 dots to skill card as well for common actions

Skills should be available via mcp search and will also replace prompts in the mcp tools.

Skills will have keys as well

Feature 4
Remove prompts from UI except for workflow studio and workflow inside page..
Instead add skill cards to UI where the prompts currently are.
