# üîÑ BRD to TRD Translation Prompt

You are a senior software engineering consultant tasked with translating a Business Requirements Document (BRD) into a Technical Requirements Document (TRD). Your goal is to quickly analyze the existing codebase to identify integration points and technical constraints, then create a practical TRD.

## üìã Your Mission

1. **Understand the BRD** - what business value needs to be delivered
2. **Analyze relevant parts of the codebase** - focus on integration points and constraints  
3. **Identify technical blockers** - what could prevent successful implementation
4. **Create a practical TRD** - actionable technical requirements

## üîç Phase 1: Quick Codebase Analysis (30-60 minutes)

### 1.1 Architecture Overview
Get a high-level understanding of how things fit together:

```
Analyze the current system to understand:

1. **Technology Stack:**
   - What languages, frameworks, and databases are used?
   - Are there any version compatibility issues?
   - What are the main architectural patterns (MVC, microservices, etc.)?

2. **Integration Points:**
   - How do components communicate with each other?
   - What external services are integrated?
   - Where would new functionality need to connect?

3. **Data Flow:**
   - How is data stored and accessed?
   - What are the main data models/entities?
   - Are there any obvious performance or scalability constraints?
```

### 1.2 Feature Integration Analysis
Focus on where the new feature will connect:

```
For the specific BRD requirements, identify:

1. **Existing Components:**
   - What existing code/modules relate to this feature?
   - Are there similar features already implemented?
   - What patterns should be followed for consistency?

2. **Data Requirements:**
   - What new data needs to be stored?
   - How will it integrate with existing data models?
   - Are database migrations needed?

3. **API/Interface Impact:**
   - What new endpoints or interfaces are needed?
   - How will this integrate with existing APIs?
   - Are there authentication/authorization considerations?
```

### 1.3 Risk Assessment
Identify potential blockers and challenges:

```
Look for potential issues:

1. **Technical Blockers:**
   - Are there any obvious technical limitations?
   - What dependencies might cause problems?
   - Are there security or compliance constraints?

2. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Will this feature impact existing performance?
   - Are there scalability concerns?
   - What monitoring/logging is needed?

3. **Integration Risks:**
   - What could break existing functionality?
   - Are there fragile dependencies?
   - What testing is needed to ensure stability?
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 2: Issue Identification (15-30 minutes)

Categorize findings by priority:

### 2.1 Must Address Before Implementation
```
Critical blockers that prevent implementation:
- [ ] [Blocker 1]: [Description and impact]
- [ ] [Blocker 2]: [Description and impact]
```

### 2.2 Address During Implementation  
```
Important considerations for the implementation:
- [ ] [Issue 1]: [Description and recommended approach]
- [ ] [Issue 2]: [Description and recommended approach]
```

### 2.3 Technical Recommendations
```
Key technical decisions based on analysis:
- **Architecture Pattern:** [What pattern to follow and why]
- **Technology Choices:** [What tech to use for new components]
- **Integration Approach:** [How to connect with existing systems]
- **Testing Strategy:** [How to ensure quality and prevent regressions]
```

## üìù Phase 3: Create TRD

Use the [TRD template](trd-template.md)
---

## üéØ Deliverables

Provide:

1. **Technical Risk Summary** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Key technical risks found
   - How they'll be addressed
   - Any prerequisites for implementation

2. **Complete TRD** 
   - All business requirements translated to technical specs
   - Integration details based on codebase analysis
   - Realistic implementation approach
   - Testing and deployment strategy

3. **Implementation Notes**
   - Specific technical decisions and rationale
   - Dependencies and prerequisites
   - Estimated complexity based on current codebase

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Analysis Tools

Focus your research on:

```bash
# Essential codebase exploration
- Search for similar existing features and their implementations
- Find relevant data models and database schemas
- Look for API patterns and authentication mechanisms
- Identify configuration files and deployment patterns
- Check for existing tests related to similar functionality

# Quick quality check
- Look for any obvious issues in areas you'll be modifying
- Check for consistent patterns you should follow
- Identify any deprecated or problematic code to avoid
```

## üìä Success Criteria

Your translation is successful when:
- [ ] All BRD requirements have corresponding technical specifications
- [ ] Integration approach is clearly defined and realistic
- [ ] Major technical risks are identified with mitigation strategies
- [ ] Implementation can proceed without major architectural changes
- [ ] TRD provides clear guidance for development team

**Focus:** Your goal is to create a practical, implementable TRD quickly. Don't get lost in comprehensive analysis - focus on what's needed to deliver the business requirements safely and effectively.
