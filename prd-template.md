# üß† Vision

[Describe the high-level goal and value proposition of the feature. What problem does it solve and how does it benefit users?]

# üß≠ User Flow (Happy Path)

1. **[User Role]** [performs initial action]:

   - [key action details]
   - [important parameters or options]
   - [validation or configuration steps]

2. **[User Role]** [continues with next action]:

   - **[Action Type 1]** - [description of what happens]
   - **[Action Type 2]** - [alternative flow or method]
   - **[Action Type 3]** - [edge case or special handling]

3. **System** [automated processing or response]

4. **[End User]** [receives result or experiences outcome]:

   - [condition] ‚Üí [expected system behavior]
   - [natural integration or display]
   - [follow-up actions available]

# üîß Technical Considerations

### [Safety/Security Feature]

- [Method/process] ensures [data integrity requirement]
- [Bulk operations] use [safety mechanisms]
- [Multiple operation types] for different scenarios

### [Performance Considerations]

- [Feature] operates only when [optimization condition]
- [Priority/ordering] logic in [system component]
- [Filtering approach] for [performance reason]
- [Automatic updates] when [trigger condition]
- [Sorting strategy] with [fallback approach]

### [User Experience]

- [Complete functionality] coverage
- [Built-in guidance] for users
- [Multiple interaction] methods with [different behaviors]
- [Access control] by [authorization method]

### [Data Integrity]

- During [operation]: [field] automatically [behavior]
- During [display]: [validation] prevents [edge cases]
- [Redundant safety]: [primary approach] with fallback to [secondary approach]
