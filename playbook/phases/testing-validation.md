# Phase â€¢ Testing & Validation

## Goal
Validate implementation meets requirements through comprehensive testing strategy and quality assurance.

## Step Sequence
1. **create-test-plan** - develop comprehensive testing strategy
2. **execute-tests** - run all planned test scenarios
3. **validate-requirements** - verify implementation meets acceptance criteria
4. **performance-testing** [if performance requirements]
5. **security-testing** [if security requirements]
6. **user-acceptance-testing** [if user validation required]

## Context Required
- Completed implementation
- Requirements and acceptance criteria
- Test environment and data

## Skip When
- Simple configuration changes with no functional impact
- Documentation-only changes
- Emergency hotfix with deferred testing
- Testing completed in previous session

## Success Criteria
- All functional requirements validated
- Critical test scenarios passing
- Performance requirements met (if applicable)
- Security requirements validated (if applicable)
- User acceptance criteria satisfied
- No critical bugs or issues identified

## Expected Duration
**Simple:** 1-2 hours | **Standard:** 1-2 days | **Complex:** 3-5 days

## Key Outputs
- Test execution results and reports
- Validation of requirements compliance
- Performance test results (if applicable)
- Security test results (if applicable)
- User acceptance validation (if applicable)
- Issue identification and resolution
- Quality assurance sign-off
