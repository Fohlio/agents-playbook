# Phase â€¢ Analysis

## Goal
Analyze problem space, existing systems, and technical landscape to understand current state and identify optimal solution approach.

## Step Sequence
1. **trace-bug-root-cause** [if bug fixing]
2. **feature-analysis** [if working with existing features]
3. **code-analysis** [if code changes required]
4. **architecture-analysis** [if system design changes]
5. **performance-analysis** [if performance concerns]
6. **security-analysis** [if security-sensitive]
7. **dependency-analysis** [if external dependencies]

## Context Required
- Requirements from Planning phase
- Access to codebase/system (or new project confirmation)

## Skip When
- Problem is trivial and well-understood
- Emergency fix with no analysis time
- Detailed analysis completed in previous session
- Greenfield project with simple requirements

## Success Criteria
- Current state documented and problem scope defined
- Technical constraints and risks identified
- Solution approach outlined with tradeoffs
- Performance and security implications understood

## Expected Duration
**Simple:** 30-60 min | **Standard:** 1-3 hours | **Complex:** 4-8 hours

## Key Outputs
- Current state analysis report
- Problem root cause (if applicable)
- Architecture overview and constraints
- Risk assessment with mitigation strategies
- Recommended solution approach
