# Stakeholder Approval

## Goal
Obtain formal approval and sign-off from business stakeholders before proceeding with implementation or deployment.

## Context Required

- Internal technical decisions that don't require business approval
- Stakeholders are not available and approval is delegated

## Complexity Assessment
