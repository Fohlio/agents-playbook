# Step â€¢ Stakeholder Approval

## Purpose
Obtain formal approval and sign-off from business stakeholders before proceeding with implementation or deployment.

## Prerequisites
**Required MCP Servers**: 
- None (uses standard coding agent tools)

**Required Context**:
- Completed deliverable requiring approval (requirements, design, implementation, etc.)
- Identified stakeholders with approval authority

**Optional Context**:
- Approval criteria and process
- Previous stakeholder feedback
- Business impact assessment
- Risk analysis

## Validation Logic
```javascript
canExecute() {
  return hasContext('deliverable_ready_for_approval') &&
         hasContext('approval_stakeholders');
}
```

## Process
1. **Prepare approval package** - Compile all materials needed for stakeholder review
2. **Schedule stakeholder review** - Arrange meetings or review sessions with key approvers
3. **Present deliverable** - Walk through the solution with stakeholders
4. **Address questions and concerns** - Respond to feedback and clarify any issues
5. **Document approval decisions** - Record formal approval or required changes
6. **Obtain formal sign-off** - Secure written confirmation of approval
7. **Communicate approval status** - Inform project team and relevant parties

## Inputs
- Completed deliverable (requirements, design, implementation, test results, etc.)
- Stakeholder contact information and roles
- Approval criteria and success metrics
- Supporting documentation and evidence
- Business case and impact analysis

## Outputs
- Formal approval documentation
- Stakeholder feedback and comments
- Conditional approval requirements (if any)
- Risk acknowledgment and mitigation agreements
- Next steps and implementation authorization
- Communication plan for approval status

## Success Criteria
- All required stakeholders have reviewed the deliverable
- Formal approval obtained from decision-makers
- Any conditions or requirements clearly documented
- Risks acknowledged and mitigation plans approved
- Clear authorization to proceed with next steps
- Approval documented and communicated to team

## Skip Conditions
- Stakeholders have already provided approval in previous sessions
