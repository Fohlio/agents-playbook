# Step â€¢ Create TRD

## Purpose
Create comprehensive Technical Requirements Document (TRD) that translates business requirements into detailed technical specifications.

## Prerequisites
**Required MCP Servers**: 
- None (uses standard coding agent tools)

**Required Context**:
- Business requirements or BRD document
- Feature analysis or system scope

**Optional Context**:
- Existing system architecture
- Technical constraints and preferences
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements

## Validation Logic
```javascript
canExecute() {
  return hasContext('business_requirements') &&
         (hasContext('feature_scope') || hasContext('system_scope'));
}
```

## Process
1. **Analyze business requirements** - Break down business needs into technical components
2. **Define system overview** - High-level technical architecture and approach
3. **Specify functional requirements** - Detailed technical functionality specifications
4. **Define non-functional requirements** - Performance, security, scalability requirements
5. **Design data models** - Database schemas and data structures
6. **Define API specifications** - Interface contracts and communication protocols
7. **Document integration requirements** - External system connections and dependencies
8. **Create technical constraints** - Technology stack, platform, and environment requirements

## Inputs
- Business Requirements Document (BRD)
- Feature specifications and scope
- Existing system documentation
- Technical constraints and preferences
- Stakeholder requirements and feedback

## Outputs
- Comprehensive Technical Requirements Document (TRD)
- System architecture specifications
- API interface definitions
- Database schema and data models
- Integration requirements and protocols
- Performance and scalability requirements
- Security and compliance specifications
- Implementation guidelines and constraints

## Success Criteria
- All business requirements translated to technical specifications
- System architecture clearly defined
- API contracts and data models specified
- Non-functional requirements documented
- Technical constraints and guidelines established
- Implementation roadmap provided
- Stakeholder technical approval obtained

## Skip Conditions
- Technical requirements are already well-documented
- Project scope is very limited and technical specs are obvious
- Emergency implementation where TRD creation is deferred
- Technical-only project with no new requirements
