# Create TRD

## Goal
Create Technical Requirements Document translating business requirements into technical specifications.

## Context Required
- Business requirements or BRD document
- Feature/system scope definition

## Skip When
- Technical requirements already documented
- Emergency implementation (deferred TRD)
- Trivial scope with obvious tech specs

## Complexity Assessment
- **Task Complexity**: High - requires technical documentation and specification skills

## Task Understanding Assessment
If task unclear - ask clarifying questions with multiple choice options

## TRD Structure

### Core Sections
1. **Executive Summary** - objectives, approach, key decisions, timeline
2. **System Overview** - architecture diagram, tech stack, environments, dependencies
3. **Functional Requirements** - features, UI specs, business logic, workflows
4. **Non-Functional Requirements** - performance, scalability, security, reliability
5. **Data Requirements** - models, database design, validation, storage
6. **API Specifications** - endpoints, formats, auth, errors, limits
7. **Integration Requirements** - external APIs, sync, queues, webhooks, SSO
8. **Infrastructure Requirements** - servers, network, deployment, monitoring, backup

### Implementation Focus
- **Development Standards** - code organization, patterns, testing
- **Architecture Patterns** - design patterns, error handling, config
- **Technical Constraints** - languages, frameworks, platforms, compliance
- **Performance Constraints** - response times, capacity, throughput

## Key Outputs
- Complete TRD document with all 8 sections
- Technical specifications ready for implementation
- API contracts and data models defined
- Infrastructure and deployment requirements
- Implementation guidelines and constraints

## Quality Checks
- All business requirements translated to technical specs
- Architecture clearly defined and documented
- Technical constraints and guidelines established
- Stakeholder technical review completed
