# Document Decisions

## Goal
Capture and document key technical and business decisions made during the project for future reference and knowledge preservation.

## Context Required
- Completed project phase or major decisions made
- Decision outcomes and rationale

## Skip When
- Only trivial decisions with no long-term impact were made
- Decisions are well-documented elsewhere
- Emergency situation where documentation is deferred
- Decisions are temporary and will be revisited soon

## Complexity Assessment
- **Task Complexity**: Medium - requires documentation and decision analysis skills

## Task Understanding Assessment
If task unclear - ask clarifying questions with multiple choice options

## Decision Categories

### Technical Decisions
- **Architecture Decisions** - system design and structure choices
- **Technology Stack** - programming languages, frameworks, and tools
- **Integration Patterns** - how systems connect and communicate
- **Data Architecture** - database design and data flow decisions
- **Security Approach** - authentication, authorization, and protection methods

### Business Decisions
- **Feature Prioritization** - what features to build first
- **Scope Changes** - additions or removals from project scope
- **Resource Allocation** - team assignments and budget decisions
- **Timeline Adjustments** - schedule changes and milestone updates
- **Risk Mitigation** - how to address identified risks

### Process Decisions
- **Development Methodology** - Agile, waterfall, or hybrid approaches
- **Quality Assurance** - testing strategies and quality gates
- **Deployment Strategy** - how and when to release changes
- **Communication Plan** - how to keep stakeholders informed
- **Change Management** - how to handle scope and requirement changes

### Design Decisions
- **User Experience** - interface design and interaction patterns
- **Performance Optimization** - speed and efficiency trade-offs
- **Scalability Approach** - how to handle growth and load
- **Maintainability** - code organization and documentation standards
- **Accessibility** - how to support users with disabilities

## Decision Documentation Structure

### Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Template
- **Decision ID** - unique identifier for tracking
- **Decision Title** - clear, descriptive title
- **Status** - proposed, accepted, superseded, or deprecated
- **Date** - when the decision was made
- **Stakeholders** - who was involved in the decision
- **Context** - background and situation leading to decision
- **Decision** - what was decided
- **Rationale** - why this decision was made
- **Consequences** - expected outcomes and implications
- **Alternatives** - other options considered and why they were rejected

### ADR Example Format
```
# ADR-001: Use Microservices Architecture

## Status: Accepted
## Date: 2024-01-15
## Stakeholders: Tech Lead, Architects, Product Owner

## Context
Need scalable system for growth and independent team development.

## Decision
Use microservices architecture with API gateway pattern.

## Rationale
- Independent scaling of components
- Team independence
- Technology diversity support
- Improved fault isolation

## Consequences
- Increased deployment complexity
- Network latency between services
- Need distributed system expertise
- More complex testing

## Alternatives Considered
- Monolithic: Simpler but less scalable
- Modular monolith: Better than pure monolith but still coupled
```

## Documentation Best Practices

### Content Guidelines
- Use clear, jargon-free language
- Provide sufficient context for future readers
- Include specific examples and scenarios
- Document assumptions and constraints
- Explain technical terms and concepts

### Organization and Access
- Use unique identifiers for each decision
- Store in centralized, searchable location
- Use consistent formatting and templates
- Tag decisions by category and topic
- Make accessible to all team members

### Maintenance
- Schedule periodic review of decisions
- Update status when decisions are superseded
- Mark deprecated decisions clearly
- Track decision evolution over time
- Learn from decision outcomes

## Common Decision Types

### Technology Selection
- Programming language and framework choices
- Database and storage technology decisions
- Third-party service and tool selections
- Cloud provider and infrastructure decisions
- Monitoring and observability tool choices

### Architecture Patterns
- Microservices vs monolithic architecture
- Synchronous vs asynchronous communication
- Event-driven vs request-response patterns
- Caching strategies and implementation
- Security architecture and patterns

### Trade-off Decisions
- Performance vs maintainability balance
- Security vs usability considerations
- Cost vs feature richness decisions
- Time to market vs technical debt trade-offs
- Standardization vs flexibility choices

## Success Criteria
- All significant decisions documented with clear rationale
- Alternative options and trade-offs captured
- Decision impact and consequences understood
- Documentation accessible to future team members
- Knowledge preserved for similar future decisions
- Stakeholders informed of decision outcomes

## Key Outputs
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Business Decision Documentation
- Trade-off analysis summaries
- Decision impact assessments
- Lessons learned documentation
- Knowledge base updates
