# Step â€¢ Feature Analysis

## Purpose
Analyze existing feature functionality, architecture, and implementation to understand current state and identify opportunities for improvement or modification.

## Prerequisites
**Required MCP Servers**: 
- None (uses standard coding agent tools)

**Required Context**:
- Feature scope and boundaries definition
- Access to relevant codebase

**Optional Context**:
- User documentation and requirements
- Performance metrics and monitoring data
- User feedback and usage analytics
- Related features and dependencies

## Validation Logic
```javascript
canExecute() {
  return hasContext('feature_scope') &&
         hasContext('codebase_access');
}
```

## Process
1. **Map feature boundaries** - Identify all components and code involved in the feature
2. **Analyze user flows** - Understand how users interact with the feature
3. **Examine code architecture** - Review implementation patterns and structure
4. **Identify data flow** - Trace how data moves through the feature
5. **Assess dependencies** - Map internal and external dependencies
6. **Evaluate performance** - Analyze current performance characteristics
7. **Document findings** - Create comprehensive feature analysis report

- What are the key algorithms and data structures?
- How does it integrate with other system components?

### Data Analysis
- What data does the feature create, read, update, or delete?
- How is data validated and transformed?
- What are the data schemas and relationships?
- How is data persisted and retrieved?

### User Experience Analysis
- How do users interact with the feature?
- What is the user interface and interaction flow?
- What feedback and error handling is provided?
- How intuitive and usable is the feature?

### Performance Analysis
- How does the feature perform under normal load?
- What are the bottlenecks and resource consumption patterns?
- How does it scale with increased usage?
- What caching and optimization strategies are used?
- What monitoring and alerting is in place?
