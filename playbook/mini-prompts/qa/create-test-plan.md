# Step â€¢ Create Test Plan

## Purpose
Develop comprehensive test strategy and test cases to ensure implementation meets requirements and quality standards.

## Prerequisites
**Required MCP Servers**: 
- None (uses standard coding agent tools)

**Required Context**:
- Requirements and acceptance criteria
- Implementation details or design specifications

**Optional Context**:
- Existing test suites
- Testing frameworks and tools
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements

## Validation Logic
```javascript
canExecute() {
  return hasContext('requirements') &&
         (hasContext('implementation') || hasContext('design_specifications'));
}
```

## Process
1. **Analyze requirements for testability** - Break down requirements into testable scenarios
2. **Design test strategy** - Define testing approach and coverage goals
3. **Create test cases** - Develop detailed test scenarios for functional requirements
4. **Plan edge case testing** - Identify boundary conditions and error scenarios
5. **Design integration tests** - Plan testing of component interactions
6. **Plan performance testing** - Define performance test scenarios (if applicable)
7. **Document test plan** - Create comprehensive test documentation

## Inputs
- Requirements document and acceptance criteria
- Implementation details or design specifications
- Existing test framework and tools
- Performance and security requirements
- User stories and use cases

## Outputs
- Comprehensive test plan document
- Detailed test cases with steps and expected results
- Edge case and error scenario test cases
- Integration test scenarios
- Performance test plan (if applicable)
- Test data requirements
- Test environment specifications

## Success Criteria
- All functional requirements covered by test cases
- Edge cases and error scenarios identified and planned
- Test cases are clear, specific, and executable
- Integration points thoroughly tested
- Performance requirements addressed (if applicable)
- Test plan approved by stakeholders
- Test environment and data requirements defined

## Skip Conditions
- Simple configuration changes with no functional impact
- Documentation-only changes
- Emergency hotfix where testing plan is deferred
- Testing strategy already exists and is comprehensive

## Test Planning Categories

### Functional Testing
- **Happy Path Tests**: Normal usage scenarios with valid inputs
- **Business Logic Tests**: Core functionality and business rules
- **User Interface Tests**: UI interactions and user experience
- **API Tests**: Endpoint functionality and contract validation
- **Data Validation Tests**: Input validation and data processing

### Non-Functional Testing
- **Performance Tests**: Load, stress, and scalability testing
- **Security Tests**: Authentication, authorization, and vulnerability testing
- **Usability Tests**: User experience and accessibility testing
- **Compatibility Tests**: Browser, device, and environment compatibility
- **Reliability Tests**: System stability and error recovery

### Integration Testing
- **Component Integration**: Testing interactions between modules
- **System Integration**: Testing with external systems and APIs
- **Database Integration**: Data persistence and retrieval testing
- **User Interface Integration**: Frontend-backend integration
- **Third-Party Integration**: External service and library testing

### Edge Case Testing
- **Boundary Value Tests**: Testing limits and edge conditions
- **Error Handling Tests**: Invalid inputs and error scenarios
- **Concurrency Tests**: Multiple user and parallel processing scenarios
- **Resource Limitation Tests**: Low memory, disk space, network issues
- **Data Edge Cases**: Empty, null, very large, or malformed data

## Test Case Structure
- **Test Case ID**: Unique identifier for tracking
- **Test Description**: Clear description of what is being tested
- **Preconditions**: Setup required before test execution
- **Test Steps**: Detailed steps to execute the test
- **Expected Results**: What should happen if implementation is correct
- **Test Data**: Specific data required for test execution
- **Priority**: Critical, high, medium, low priority classification

## Test Strategy Framework

### Test Pyramid Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component and function testing
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflow testing
- **Manual Tests**: Exploratory and usability testing

### Risk-Based Testing
- **High-Risk Areas**: Critical functionality and frequent change areas
- **Medium-Risk Areas**: Important but stable functionality
- **Low-Risk Areas**: Simple or rarely used functionality
- **Risk Mitigation**: Extra testing for high-risk areas

### Continuous Testing
- **Automated Tests**: Tests that can run automatically in CI/CD
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure existing functionality remains intact
- **Smoke Tests**: Basic functionality verification after deployment
- **Acceptance Tests**: Final validation before release

## Test Environment Planning
- **Test Data Requirements**: What data is needed for testing
- **Environment Configuration**: Hardware, software, and network setup
- **Test Tool Requirements**: Testing frameworks and tools needed
- **Access Requirements**: Permissions and credentials needed
- **Environment Isolation**: Separation from production and development

## Common Test Scenarios

### User Authentication Tests
- Valid login with correct credentials
- Invalid login attempts with wrong credentials
- Password reset functionality
- Session timeout and re-authentication
- User role and permission validation

### Data Validation Tests
- Required field validation
- Data type and format validation
- Business rule validation
- Duplicate data handling
- Data sanitization and security

### Error Handling Tests
- Network connectivity issues
- Database connection failures
- Invalid API responses
- System overload scenarios
- Graceful degradation testing

### Performance Tests
- Response time under normal load
- System behavior under peak load
- Memory and resource usage
- Database query performance
- Concurrent user handling

## Documentation Format
- **Test Plan Overview**: Scope, objectives, and strategy
- **Test Environment**: Setup and configuration requirements
- **Test Cases**: Detailed test scenarios and procedures
- **Test Schedule**: Timeline and milestones
- **Roles and Responsibilities**: Who does what during testing
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues and mitigation strategies
- **Success Criteria**: Definition of acceptable test results

## Notes
- Balance thorough testing with project timeline and resources
- Focus testing effort on high-risk and high-impact areas
- Design tests to be maintainable and reusable
- Consider automation opportunities from the beginning
- Get stakeholder input on critical test scenarios
- Plan for both positive and negative test cases
