# Step â€¢ Setup CI/CD Pipeline

## Purpose
Establish automated continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines to streamline development workflows, improve code quality, and enable reliable deployments.

## Prerequisites
**Required MCP Servers**: 
- None (uses standard CI/CD tools)

**Required Context**:
- Source code repository and project structure
- Target deployment environments

**Optional Context**:
- Existing CI/CD infrastructure
- Testing framework and test suites
- Deployment requirements and constraints
- Code quality standards and tools

## Validation Logic
```javascript
canExecute() {
  return hasContext('source_repository') &&
         hasContext('deployment_environments') &&
         requiresCICD() &&
         hasRepositoryAccess();
}

requiresCICD() {
  return needsAutomatedTesting() ||
         needsAutomatedDeployment() ||
         needsCodeQualityChecks() ||
         hasMultipleEnvironments();
}
```

## Process
1. **Analyze project requirements** - Review codebase, testing needs, and deployment requirements
2. **Choose CI/CD platform** - Select appropriate CI/CD service based on requirements
3. **Configure build pipeline** - Set up automated building and compilation
4. **Implement automated testing** - Configure unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
5. **Set up code quality checks** - Implement linting, security scanning, and quality gates
6. **Configure deployment pipeline** - Automate deployment to different environments
7. **Implement monitoring and notifications** - Set up pipeline monitoring and team notifications
8. **Document pipeline processes** - Create documentation for pipeline usage and maintenance
