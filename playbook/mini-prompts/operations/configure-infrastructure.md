# Step â€¢ Configure Infrastructure

## Purpose
Set up, configure, and manage infrastructure components including servers, networks, storage, and cloud resources for optimal performance and security.

## Prerequisites
**Required MCP Servers**:

- Compliance and security requirements
- Performance and scalability requirements
- Budget and cost constraints

## Validation Logic
```javascript
canExecute() {
  return hasContext('infrastructure_requirements') &&
         hasContext('target_environment') &&
         hasInfrastructureAccess() &&
         requiresInfrastructureSetup();
}

requiresInfrastructureSetup() {
  return needsNewInfrastructure() ||
         needsInfrastructureChanges() ||
         needsConfigurationUpdates() ||
         needsOptimization();
}
```

5. **Install and configure software** - Set up operating systems, middleware, and required software
6. **Implement monitoring and logging** - Configure infrastructure monitoring and log collection
7. **Test infrastructure setup** - Validate functionality, performance, and security
8. **Document infrastructure configuration** - Create documentation and diagrams
