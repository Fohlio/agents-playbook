# Step â€¢ Manage Secrets and Credentials

## Purpose
Securely manage, store, and distribute sensitive information including passwords, API keys, certificates, and other credentials across applications and infrastructure.

## Prerequisites
**Required MCP Servers**: 
- None (uses standard security tools)

**Required Context**:
- Application or system requiring credentials
- Security requirements and compliance needs

**Optional Context**:
- Existing secrets management system
- Compliance frameworks (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI DSS)
- Team access requirements
- Audit and rotation policies

## Validation Logic
```javascript
canExecute() {
  return hasContext('application_system') &&
         hasContext('security_requirements') &&
         hasSecretsToManage() &&
         hasSecurityAccess();
}

hasSecretsToManage() {
  return hasPasswords() ||
         hasAPIKeys() ||
         hasCertificates() ||
         hasConnectionStrings() ||
         hasEncryptionKeys();
}
```

## Process
1. **Inventory existing secrets** - Identify all credentials, keys, and sensitive data
2. **Choose secrets management solution** - Select appropriate secrets management platform
3. **Migrate secrets to secure storage** - Move credentials from insecure locations
4. **Implement access controls** - Configure role-based access and permissions
5. **Set up secret rotation** - Implement automatic or scheduled credential rotation
6. **Configure application integration** - Update applications to retrieve secrets securely
7. **Implement audit logging** - Enable logging for all secret access and modifications
8. **Document procedures** - Create documentation for secret management processes

## Secret Storage Best Practices

### Storage Security
- **Encryption at rest**: All secrets encrypted when stored
- **Encryption in transit**: Secure communication protocols
- **Access logging**: Track all secret access and modifications
- **Regular backups**: Secure backup and recovery procedures

### Access Control
- **Least privilege**: Minimum necessary access to secrets
- **Role-based access**: Access based on job functions and responsibilities
- **Time-limited access**: Temporary access for specific tasks
- **Multi-factor authentication**: Additional security for administrative access

### Secret Rotation
- **Automatic rotation**: Scheduled rotation for supported services
- **Manual rotation**: Process for rotating non-automated secrets
- **Zero-downtime rotation**: Rotation without service interruption
- **Rollback procedures**: Ability to revert to previous secrets if needed

## Application Integration

### Development Environment
- **Local development**: Secure secret access for developers
- **Development databases**: Non-production credentials
- **Testing environments**: Isolated secrets for testing
- **CI/CD integration**: Secure secret injection in build pipelines

### Production Environment
- **Runtime secret retrieval**: Applications fetch secrets at startup or runtime
- **Secure caching**: Temporary secure storage of retrieved secrets
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of secret retrieval failures
- **Performance optimization**: Efficient secret retrieval without impact

### Container Integration
- **Init containers**: Retrieve secrets before application startup
- **Sidecar containers**: Dedicated containers for secret management
- **Volume mounts**: Secure mounting of secrets as files
- **Environment injection**: Secure injection of secrets as environment variables

## Secret Rotation Strategies

### Automatic Rotation
- **Database credentials**: Automatic rotation with database provider APIs
- **API keys**: Automated rotation through service provider APIs
- **Certificates**: Automatic renewal and deployment of SSL certificates
- **System passwords**: Scheduled rotation of service account passwords

### Manual Rotation
