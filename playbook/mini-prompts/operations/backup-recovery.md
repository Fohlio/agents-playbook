## Validation Logic
```javascript
canExecute() {
  return hasContext('system_architecture') &&
         hasContext('recovery_requirements') &&
         hasCriticalDataAssets() &&
         hasBackupAccess();
}

hasCriticalDataAssets() {
  return hasDatabases() ||
         hasApplicationData() ||

## Backup Types and Strategies

### Full Backup
- **Complete data copy**: Back up entire dataset or system
- **Recovery simplicity**: Fastest recovery time from single backup
- **Storage intensive**: Requires most storage space and time
- **Frequency**: Weekly or monthly for large datasets

### Incremental Backup
- **Changed data only**: Back up only data changed since last backup
- **Storage efficient**: Minimal storage space and backup time
- **Recovery complexity**: Requires base backup plus all incremental backups
- **Frequency**: Daily or hourly for frequent data changes

### Differential Backup
- **Changes since full**: Back up all changes since last full backup
- **Balanced approach**: Balance between storage and recovery complexity
- **Recovery moderate**: Requires full backup plus latest differential
- **Frequency**: Daily backups with weekly full backups

### Snapshot Backup
- **Point-in-time copy**: Instant snapshot of data at specific moment
- **Fast creation**: Minimal impact on running systems
- **Storage dependent**: Requires snapshot-capable storage systems
- **Use cases**: Database backups and system state preservation

## Data Categories

### Database Backups
- **Transactional consistency**: Ensure ACID properties during backup
- **Online backups**: Backup without stopping database services
- **Transaction log backups**: Capture incremental changes for point-in-time recovery
- **Cross-region replication**: Geographic distribution for disaster recovery

### Application Data
- **User-generated content**: Files, documents, and media uploaded by users
- **Configuration data**: Application settings, preferences, and customizations
- **Session data**: User sessions and temporary application state
- **Cache data**: Consider if cache data needs backup or can be regenerated

### System Configuration
- **Operating system configuration**: System settings and configurations
- **Application configuration**: Application-specific settings and parameters
- **Network configuration**: Firewall rules, load balancer settings, DNS records
- **Infrastructure as code**: Terraform, CloudFormation, and automation scripts

### Code and Artifacts
- **Source code**: Application source code and version history
- **Build artifacts**: Compiled applications, Docker images, and packages
- **Deployment scripts**: Automation scripts and deployment configurations
- **Documentation**: Technical documentation and operational procedures

## Backup Infrastructure

### Storage Options
- **Local storage**: On-site backup storage for fast recovery
- **Cloud storage**: Remote cloud storage for geographic distribution
- **Hybrid approach**: Combination of local and cloud storage
- **Tape storage**: Long-term archival storage for compliance

### Backup Tools
- **Database-native tools**: Built-in backup utilities for databases
- **File system tools**: rsync, tar, and file-level backup utilities
- **Enterprise backup solutions**: Veeam, Commvault, and comprehensive platforms
- **Cloud backup services**: AWS Backup, Azure Backup, Google Cloud Backup

### Security Considerations
- **Encryption at rest**: Encrypt all backup data in storage
- **Encryption in transit**: Secure data transmission during backup
- **Access controls**: Restrict access to backup data and systems
- **Immutable backups**: Prevent backup data from being modified or deleted

## Recovery Procedures

### Recovery Types
- **File-level recovery**: Restore specific files or directories
- **Database recovery**: Restore databases to specific point in time
- **System recovery**: Complete system restoration from backup
