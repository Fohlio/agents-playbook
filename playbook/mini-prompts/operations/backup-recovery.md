# Backup and Recovery

## Goal
Implement comprehensive backup and disaster recovery procedures to protect against data loss, ensure business continuity, and meet recovery time and point objectives.

## Context Required
- System architecture and critical data assets
- Recovery requirements (RTO/RPO)
- Existing backup infrastructure

## Skip When
- Comprehensive backup and recovery already implemented
- Data is not critical or easily replaceable
- Backup and recovery managed by dedicated team
- System uses fully managed services with built-in backup

## Complexity Assessment
- **Task Complexity**: High - requires backup/recovery expertise and infrastructure planning

## Task Understanding Assessment
If task unclear - ask clarifying questions with multiple choice options

## Backup Types

### Full Backup
- Complete data copy of entire dataset or system
- Fastest recovery time from single backup
- Storage intensive, typically weekly/monthly

### Incremental Backup
- Back up only data changed since last backup
- Storage efficient, minimal backup time
- Recovery requires base backup plus all incremental backups
- Typically daily or hourly

### Differential Backup
- Back up all changes since last full backup
- Balance between storage and recovery complexity
- Recovery requires full backup plus latest differential
- Typically daily backups with weekly full backups

### Snapshot Backup
- Point-in-time copy, instant snapshot
- Fast creation, minimal impact on running systems
- Requires snapshot-capable storage systems
- Used for database backups and system state

## Data Categories

### Database Backups
- **Transactional consistency** - ensure ACID properties during backup
- **Online backups** - backup without stopping database services
- **Transaction log backups** - capture incremental changes for point-in-time recovery
- **Cross-region replication** - geographic distribution for disaster recovery

### Application Data
- **User-generated content** - files, documents, media uploaded by users
- **Configuration data** - application settings, preferences, customizations
- **Session data** - user sessions and temporary application state
- **Cache data** - determine if cache needs backup or can be regenerated

### System Configuration
- **Operating system** - system settings and configurations
- **Application configuration** - application-specific settings and parameters
- **Network configuration** - firewall rules, load balancer settings, DNS records
- **Infrastructure as code** - Terraform, CloudFormation, automation scripts

### Code and Artifacts
- **Source code** - application source code and version history
- **Build artifacts** - compiled applications, Docker images, packages
- **Deployment scripts** - automation scripts and deployment configurations
- **Documentation** - technical documentation and operational procedures

## Backup Infrastructure

### Storage Options
- **Local storage** - on-site backup storage for fast recovery
- **Cloud storage** - remote cloud storage for geographic distribution
- **Hybrid approach** - combination of local and cloud storage
- **Tape storage** - long-term archival storage for compliance

### Backup Tools
- **Database-native tools** - built-in backup utilities for databases
- **File system tools** - rsync, tar, file-level backup utilities
- **Enterprise solutions** - Veeam, Commvault, comprehensive platforms
- **Cloud services** - AWS Backup, Azure Backup, Google Cloud Backup

### Security Considerations
- **Encryption at rest** - encrypt all backup data in storage
- **Encryption in transit** - secure data transmission during backup
- **Access controls** - restrict access to backup data and systems
- **Immutable backups** - prevent backup data from being modified or deleted

## Recovery Procedures

### Recovery Types
- **File-level recovery** - restore specific files or directories
- **Database recovery** - restore databases to specific point in time
- **System recovery** - complete system restoration from backup
- **Disaster recovery** - full infrastructure and data recovery

### Recovery Testing
- **Regular testing** - scheduled testing of recovery procedures
- **Partial recovery** - test recovery of specific components or data
- **Full disaster simulation** - complete disaster recovery testing
- **Documentation updates** - update procedures based on test results

### Recovery Optimization
- **Recovery prioritization** - identify critical systems for priority recovery
- **Parallel recovery** - recover multiple systems simultaneously
- **Recovery automation** - automate recovery procedures where possible
- **Warm standby** - maintain standby systems for faster recovery

## Disaster Recovery Planning

### Risk Assessment
- **Natural disasters** - earthquakes, floods, fires, weather events
- **Human errors** - accidental deletion, configuration mistakes
- **Cyber attacks** - ransomware, data corruption, system compromise
- **Infrastructure failures** - hardware failures, network outages, power loss

### Recovery Site Options
- **Hot site** - fully equipped site ready for immediate operation
- **Warm site** - partially equipped site requiring setup time
- **Cold site** - basic facilities requiring full equipment installation
- **Cloud-based DR** - cloud infrastructure for disaster recovery

### Communication Plan
- **Emergency contacts** - key personnel and contact information
- **Communication channels** - primary and backup communication methods
- **Status updates** - regular updates to stakeholders during recovery
- **Media relations** - public communication strategy if necessary

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Backup Monitoring
- **Backup job status** - monitor success and failure of backup jobs
- **Backup integrity** - verify backup data integrity and completeness
- **Storage utilization** - monitor backup storage capacity and usage
- **Performance monitoring** - track backup duration and throughput

### Alert Configuration
- **Failure alerts** - immediate notification of backup failures
- **Capacity warnings** - alert before storage capacity limits
- **Integrity alerts** - notification of backup corruption or validation failures
- **Performance alerts** - alert on backup duration exceeding thresholds

## Success Criteria
- All critical data backed up according to defined schedule
- Backup integrity verified through regular testing
- Recovery procedures tested and documented
- RTO and RPO objectives consistently met
- Backup monitoring provides early warning of issues
- Team trained on recovery procedures and contacts
- Compliance requirements met for data protection

## Key Outputs
- Comprehensive backup strategy implemented
- Automated backup processes for all critical data
- Tested recovery procedures and documentation
- Backup monitoring and alerting configured
- Disaster recovery plan with defined procedures
- Regular backup testing and validation processes
