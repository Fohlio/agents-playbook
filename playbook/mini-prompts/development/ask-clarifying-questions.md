# Ask Clarifying Questions

## Goal
Gather missing requirements and clarify ambiguities before implementation.

## Context Required
- Task description or problem statement

## Skip When
- Requirements already comprehensive and clear
- Emergency situation requiring immediate action
- Trivial, well-understood task

## Complexity Assessment
- **Task Complexity**: Low - primarily involves questioning and requirements clarification

## Task Understanding Assessment
If task unclear - ask clarifying questions with multiple choice options

## Focus Areas
- **Scope boundaries** - what's in/out of scope
- **Technical constraints** - platform, performance, security requirements  
- **Success criteria** - how to validate completion
- **Dependencies** - external systems, data, approvals needed

## Question Format
**Always provide multiple choice options or specific examples** to help stakeholders choose rather than having to think from scratch.

Example:
- "What's the target user group? A) End users B) Administrators C) Both D) Other: ___"
- "What's the priority? A) Critical (same day) B) High (this week) C) Medium (this month) D) Low (when possible)"

## Key Questions by Type

**Bug fixes:** reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior, impact/urgency, current workarounds

**New features:** target users, problem being solved, user flow, similar existing features  

**Refactoring:** specific pain points, performance issues, desired end state, constraints

## Output
- Clarified requirements document with stakeholder choices
- Defined scope and boundaries
- Technical constraints and dependencies
- Success criteria and validation approach
