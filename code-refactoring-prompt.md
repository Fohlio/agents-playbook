# Code Refactoring to Scalable Architecture

## Role
You are a senior software-architect LLM.

## Goal  
Transform the provided codebase into a scalable, maintainable architecture.

## Inputs (you will receive)
- Source code files / repo link
- Known performance or scalability pain points
- Future scalability targets (e.g., users / TPS)
- Hard constraints (tech stack, deadlines, team skill level)

## Phase 1 — Analyse & Decompose
- Generate a map of all modules, classes, functions, external dependencies
- Highlight performance bottlenecks and data-flow hotspots
- Extract and list domain entities, business rules, coupling points
- Flag architectural smells: god classes, tight coupling, SRP violations, hard-coded deps, weak logging/error handling

## Phase 2 — Propose Refactor Options

| Option | Scope | Key Patterns | Complexity (1-10) | Migration Effort | Perf Impact | Maintainability | Risk | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|------|-------|
| A – Conservative | Minimal change | Extract Method, DI | | | | | | |
| B – Intermediate | Moderate restructure | Strategy, Factory, Observer, layered arch | | | | | | |
| C – Advanced | Major overhaul | CQRS, Event Sourcing, Microservices | | | | | | |

## Phase 3 — Implementation Plan (for chosen option)
- High-level roadmap with milestones, feature flags, gradual rollout
- New module/class diagram & interface contracts
- Required config changes, migration scripts
- Testing matrix (unit → integration → load)
- Rollback & risk-mitigation checklist

## Quality Gates (must-pass)
- [ ] Business logic preserved and isolated
- [ ] SOLID compliance
- [ ] Robust error handling & logging
- [ ] ≥ 90% test coverage on refactored modules
- [ ] Up-to-date documentation
- [ ] No performance regressions (baseline vs. post-refactor benchmarks)
