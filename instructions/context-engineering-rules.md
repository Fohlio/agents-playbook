# ðŸ“š Context Engineering Rules

These rules apply to **all** prompts in the AI Agents Playbook.  Reference this document instead of duplicating the same blocks in every prompt.

---
## 1. Standard Workflow
1. **Read Context First**  
   â€¢ docs/project-navigation.md â€“ single source of truth  
   â€¢ docs/examples/ â€“ patterns & anti-patterns
2. **Gather Missing Context**  
   â€¢ Search codebase & docs  
   â€¢ Ask clarifying questions (see Â§2)
3. **Confidence Check**  
   Rate each area 1-10.  If any <7 â†’ gather more context before coding.
4. **Implement Task-Specific Steps**
5. **Validate** â€“ run quality-gates (see Â§3)
6. **Self-Correct** â€“ iterate until confidence â‰¥7/10 & all gates pass.

---
## 2. Clarifying Questions (Cheat-Sheet)
Ask only what is missing â€“ propose answer options to speed decision-making.

â€¢ **Code Examples & Patterns** â€“ good vs bad, testing patterns
â€¢ **Rules & Standards** â€“ coding style, performance, security, "never-touch" areas
â€¢ **Validation & Quality Gates** â€“ required commands, coverage targets, benchmarks
â€¢ **Legacy Context** â€“ support timeline, migration constraints
â€¢ **Confidence** â€“ which areas are unclear to the team/agent
â€¢ **Additional Clarifying Questions** â€“ any questions that deem important for you to accomplish the task with options to select.

## 3. Validation Checklist
Use or adapt this list for any deliverable.

- [ ] Examples from docs/examples/ referenced
- [ ] Project standards from project-navigation.md followed
- [ ] Validation commands pass (`test`, `lint`, `build`, etc.)
- [ ] Confidence â‰¥7/10 for all key areas
- [ ] Another developer/agent can proceed without extra context

---
## 4. Self-Correction Loop
1. **Identify Gaps** â€“ which checklist items fail?  
2. **Research / Ask** â€“ collect missing context  
3. **Update** â€“ refine deliverable & confidence scores  
4. **Re-validate** â€“ repeat until all pass

---
## 6. Confidence Scale
1 - 3 = Vague / high risk  
4 - 6 = Partial context, needs work  
7 - 8 = Good understanding  
9 - 10 = Crystal-clear, ready for production
