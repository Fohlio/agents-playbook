# Web Development Init Workflow - Requirements Document

## Introduction
Comprehensive workflow for initializing web development projects with standardized structure analysis, data flow mapping, and UI component management system. This workflow provides systematic approach to understanding and documenting existing web projects or setting up new ones with proper architectural foundations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project Structure Analysis
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze and document the basic project structure and module hierarchy, so that I can understand the foundational architecture and folder organization methodology.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN analyzing project structure THEN system SHALL identify main modules hierarchy and dependencies
2. WHEN evaluating folder structure THEN system SHALL document the organizational methodology (feature-based, layer-based, domain-driven, etc.)
3. WHEN documenting structure THEN system SHALL create standardized project structure documentation
4. WHEN completing analysis THEN system SHALL validate folder structure consistency and best practices compliance

### Requirement 2: Data Flow Mapping
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand how data flows from backend to frontend, so that I can implement consistent data handling patterns and integration strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN analyzing data flow THEN system SHALL identify backend-to-client data passing patterns (REST, GraphQL, WebSocket, etc.)
2. WHEN examining data handling THEN system SHALL document mapping and store system patterns (Redux, Zustand, Context API, etc.)
3. WHEN evaluating integration points THEN system SHALL identify API endpoints and data transformation layers
4. WHEN documenting patterns THEN system SHALL create data flow diagrams and integration documentation

### Requirement 3: UI Component Management System
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to catalog and manage UI components systematically, so that I can maintain consistency and avoid duplication in the user interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN discovering UI components THEN system SHALL ask user for component locations and scan specified directories
2. WHEN analyzing components THEN system SHALL create ui.json file with component metadata (name, location, description, usage context)
3. WHEN documenting components THEN system SHALL include deprecation status (true/false) for each component
4. WHEN completing UI analysis THEN system SHALL document design system information, UI libraries used, folder structure methodology, common patterns, and theme configurations in ui.json

### Requirement 4: Workflow Integration
**User Story:** As a developer using agents-playbook, I want the web-development init workflow to integrate seamlessly with existing workflow system, so that I can use it alongside other development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN creating workflow THEN system SHALL follow existing YAML workflow structure and naming conventions
2. WHEN defining phases THEN system SHALL use consistent phase naming with existing workflows (analysis, design-architecture, planning, implementation, testing-review)
3. WHEN implementing mini-prompts THEN system SHALL create focused mini-prompts for each phase following established patterns
4. WHEN completing workflow THEN system SHALL ensure MCP server compatibility and semantic search integration

### Requirement 5: Quality and Validation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want each step to be validated and documented, so that I can trust the analysis results and maintain high quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN executing each phase THEN system SHALL validate completion criteria before proceeding
2. WHEN documenting findings THEN system SHALL provide clear, actionable documentation for each analysis phase
3. WHEN creating outputs THEN system SHALL ensure all generated files follow project conventions and are properly formatted
4. WHEN completing workflow THEN system SHALL provide comprehensive summary and recommendations for improvements
