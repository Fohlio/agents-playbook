# Memory Board - Web Development Init Workflow

## Agent Handoffs

### Agent - Analysis → Design-Architecture - 2025-09-24T18:00:00Z
**Completed:** 
- Created comprehensive structured requirements document
- Defined 5 main requirements with clear user stories and acceptance criteria
- Analyzed project context and existing agents-playbook structure
- Validated requirements format and quality checklist compliance

**Created:** 
- `/Users/ivanbunin/projects/agents-playbook/.agents-playbook/web-development-init/requirements.md`
- Structured requirements with WHEN/THEN/SHALL acceptance criteria format

**Workflow State:** 
- workflow_id="feature-development"
- current_step=2
- context=["structured_requirements"]

**Next agent needs:** 
- Access to structured requirements for technical design
- Understanding of existing agents-playbook architecture patterns
- Knowledge of YAML workflow structure and mini-prompt conventions

**Questions:** 
- User confirmation on target project types and backend integration scope
- Approval of folder structure approach (agents-playbook/project/ vs standard workflow location)
- Validation of component analysis scope and ui.json structure

**Learnings:** 
- Web development init workflow should follow existing YAML pattern structure
- Integration with MCP server requires specific naming and tagging conventions
- UI component management requires flexible directory scanning approach

### Agent - Design-Architecture → Planning - 2025-09-24T18:30:00Z
**Completed:** 
- Created comprehensive technical design with modular three-phase architecture
- Designed TypeScript interfaces for all data models (ProjectStructure, DataFlow, UIComponent)
- Documented complete data flow transformations and integration patterns
- Defined implementation approach with 5 development phases and risk mitigation
- Specified MCP server integration and semantic search compatibility

**Created:** 
- `/Users/ivanbunin/projects/agents-playbook/.agents-playbook/web-development-init/design.md`
- `/Users/ivanbunin/projects/agents-playbook/.agents-playbook/web-development-init/flow_diagram.md`

**Workflow State:** 
- workflow_id="feature-development"
- current_step=3
- context=["structured_requirements", "design_specifications"]

**Next agent needs:** 
- Access to design specifications for implementation planning
- Understanding of existing mini-prompt patterns for creating analysis phase mini-prompts
- Knowledge of YAML workflow structure for creating web-development-init.yml

**Questions:** 
- User validation of the three-phase approach (Structure → Data Flow → UI Components)
- Approval of TypeScript interface design and data models
- Confirmation of development timeline (5-week implementation phases)

### Agent - Planning → Implementation - 2025-09-24T19:00:00Z
**Completed:** 
- Created focused implementation plan with 4 major task groups
- Analyzed existing codebase patterns for mini-prompts, workflows, and tests
- Defined specific deliverables: 3 mini-prompts, 1 YAML workflow, integration tests
- Established clear task dependencies and success criteria
- Linked all tasks to specific requirements with traceability

**Created:** 
- `/Users/ivanbunin/projects/agents-playbook/.agents-playbook/web-development-init/tasks.md`

**Workflow State:** 
- workflow_id="feature-development"
- current_step=6
- context=["structured_requirements", "design_specifications", "implementation_plan"]

**Next agent needs:** 
- Access to implementation plan for systematic task execution
- Existing mini-prompt and workflow patterns for consistent implementation
- Test integration patterns for proper validation

**Questions:** 
- User approval of focused scope (mini-prompts, YAML workflow, tests only)
- Confirmation to proceed with implementation phase

### Agent - Implementation Complete - 2025-09-24T20:00:00Z
**Completed:** 
- ✅ Created 3 analysis mini-prompts (analyze-project-structure, analyze-data-flow, analyze-ui-components)
- ✅ Created web-development-init.yml workflow file with proper MCP integration
- ✅ Added workflow to all existing integration tests
- ✅ Created specific tests for new workflow functionality
- ✅ Updated workflow embeddings for semantic search discoverability
- ✅ Fixed test issues and validated all 76 tests passing

**Created:** 
- `public/playbook/mini-prompts/analysis/analyze-project-structure.md`
- `public/playbook/mini-prompts/analysis/analyze-data-flow.md`
- `public/playbook/mini-prompts/analysis/analyze-ui-components.md`
- `public/playbook/workflows/web-development-init.yml`
- Updated test files with new workflow integration
- Updated workflow embeddings (76 tests passing)

**Workflow State:** 
- workflow_id="feature-development"
- current_step=7 (Implementation Phase Complete)
- context=["structured_requirements", "design_specifications", "implementation_plan", "implemented_feature"]

**Final Status:** 
- All deliverables successfully implemented and tested
- Semantic search integration working (workflow discovered with keywords)
- MCP server compatibility validated
- Ready for production use
