# Requirements

## Introduction

Transform the agents-playbook repository from an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server tool into a comprehensive Cursor IDE extension that enables sub-agents workflow orchestration. The extension will allow users to create orchestrator and implementer agents, assign tasks through validated workflow stages, and maintain clean context isolation between agents, similar to Claude Code's agent system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Cursor IDE, I want to create and manage sub-agents for workflow execution, so that I can orchestrate complex development tasks with specialized agents handling specific phases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a workflow THEN the system SHALL create an orchestrator agent that manages the overall workflow progression
2. WHEN the orchestrator identifies implementation phases THEN the system SHALL create implementer sub-agents with clean, isolated contexts for each phase
3. WHEN a sub-agent completes its task THEN the system SHALL update the orchestrator with progress and handoff information
4. WHEN all sub-agents complete their phases THEN the system SHALL consolidate results and mark the workflow as complete

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a workflow orchestrator agent, I want to convert MCP workflow stages into assignable sub-agent tasks, so that complex workflows can be broken down and executed by specialized agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the orchestrator receives a workflow configuration THEN the system SHALL parse YAML workflow stages into discrete sub-agent tasks
2. WHEN creating sub-agent tasks THEN the system SHALL include all required context, prerequisites, and validation criteria from the original workflow stage
3. WHEN assigning tasks THEN the system SHALL ensure each sub-agent receives only the context necessary for its specific phase
4. WHEN a workflow stage has dependencies THEN the system SHALL enforce execution order and validate prerequisites before agent assignment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a sub-agent implementer, I want access to a clean, isolated context with only the information relevant to my specific task, so that I can focus on implementation without context pollution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sub-agent is created THEN the system SHALL provide a clean context containing only task-specific requirements, design specifications, and implementation details
2. WHEN multiple sub-agents work on the same project THEN the system SHALL maintain context isolation preventing cross-contamination between agent sessions
3. WHEN a sub-agent needs project context THEN the system SHALL provide read-only access to specific project files without exposing unrelated conversation history
4. WHEN a sub-agent completes its task THEN the system SHALL capture and package its output for handoff without exposing its internal conversation context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each workflow stage to be validated through a special interface in Cursor before proceeding, so that I can ensure quality and approve each phase of the workflow execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow stage completes THEN the system SHALL present a validation interface showing deliverables, completion status, and quality metrics
2. WHEN validating a stage THEN the system SHALL allow the user to approve, request modifications, or reject the stage output
3. WHEN modifications are requested THEN the system SHALL route feedback to the appropriate sub-agent for revision
4. WHEN a stage is rejected THEN the system SHALL halt workflow progression and require issue resolution before continuing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an orchestrator agent, I want to communicate with implementer agents through a structured protocol, so that task handoffs and progress tracking are reliable and auditable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handoff information is created THEN the system SHALL use a standardized protocol including task context, acceptance criteria, and communication channels
2. WHEN progress updates are sent THEN the system SHALL include completion percentage, deliverables created, issues encountered, and next steps
3. WHEN agents communicate THEN the system SHALL log all interactions for audit and debugging purposes
4. WHEN communication fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms and fallback procedures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Cursor extension to integrate seamlessly with the existing workflow system, so that I can leverage existing mini-prompts and workflow configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension loads THEN the system SHALL discover and parse existing YAML workflow configurations
2. WHEN workflows are selected THEN the system SHALL load associated mini-prompts and preserve their structure and content
3. WHEN mini-prompts are executed THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing prerequisite checks and skip conditions
4. WHEN workflows are modified THEN the system SHALL validate changes against the established schema and maintain backward compatibility

## Validation

- Confirm each acceptance criterion is atomic, clear, and testable
- Confirm scope boundaries: transformation focuses on Cursor extension with sub-agents flow, not modification of existing workflow content
- Confirm out-of-scope items: changing existing mini-prompt content, modifying YAML workflow schemas, creating new workflow types
- Record explicit user approval before proceeding to design phase
